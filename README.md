- Manage schedule per salon (weekly schedule, date overrides, non-working days)
- Accept / reject / complete / delay bookings
- View bookings in a calendar timeline (daily and monthly views)
- View revenue and client analytics
- Create events (with optional salon association, capacity, registration, certificates)
- Manage event registrations (approve, reject, waitlist, check-in)

- Treatment records via booking outcomes

### Salon Owner / Admin
- Create and manage salon profile
- Membership management — approve/reject join requests
- Manage staff relationship type (`staff` vs. `chair_renter`)
- **Staff:** owner/admin can see booking, revenue, and calendar movement
- **Chair Renter:** independent barber — owner/admin cannot see private movement or metrics
- Relationship type management via Salon Settings
- Promote/demote salon admins
- Remove barbers from salon
- **Salon dashboard** — aggregated metrics, revenue, alerts, staff overview
- **Salon calendar** — unified view of all staff bookings
- **Salon reports** — date-range analytics with revenue, booking status, per-staff breakdown, daily trends, top services
- **Salon billing** — manage seat subscription and seat assignments
- Public booking link configuration

### Subscription & Payment System
- **Individual barber subscription** — monthly plan with trial period
- **Salon seat subscription** — salon buys seats for staff barbers
- Models: `SubscriptionPlan`, `Subscription`, `SubscriptionSeat`, `PaymentRecord`, `SubscriptionPaymentAttempt`
- **Payment attempt lifecycle:** create payment intent → pending attempt → manual/dev confirm → activate subscription
- Payment history for individual barbers and salon subscriptions
- Renewal UX through manual confirmation flow
- **Paid access enforcement:**
  - `requireBarberSubscription` middleware blocks unpaid barbers from premium features (services, schedule, bookings, calendar, portfolio, waitlist, vouchers, clients, revenue)
  - Booking creation blocks unpaid barbers
  - Unpaid/expired/stale-seat barbers hidden from public booking and favorites
- **Subscription expiration scheduler** — background cron that marks expired subscriptions (opt-in via `ENABLE_SUBSCRIPTION_EXPIRATION_CRON`)
- Dev endpoints for granting/extending subscriptions and confirming payment attempts (disabled in production)

### Privacy & Business Rules
- **Staff members** (`relationshipType: "staff"` with `relationshipStatus: "accepted"`): salon owner/admin can see booking, revenue, and calendar data
- **Chair renters** (`relationshipType: "chair_renter"`): independent — owner/admin cannot see private movement
- Relationship type management exists in Salon Settings
- Unpaid/expired barbers are hidden from public discovery and favorites
- Confirmation flow for relationship type changes exists (pending/accepted/rejected)

### Events & Certificates
- Barbers create events (title, date, time, capacity, location, certificate settings)
- Clients register for events
- Organizer approves, rejects, or moves registrations to waitlist
- Organizer marks participants as attended (check-in)
- After event ends, organizer can issue certificates to attended participants
- Certificates can be auto-generated or uploaded as PDF files
- Public certificate verification page

### Waitlist
- Clients can join a waitlist when no slot is available
- Barber reviews and can offer alternative time slots
- Client accepts or declines the offered slot
- Past-date waitlist entries expire automatically (opt-in cron)
- Notifications sent for waitlist updates

---

## Production Notes

### Environment setup

1. **CLIENT_URL** — Set to your production frontend domain (e.g. `https://app.example.com`). Multiple origins can be comma-separated.

2. **Frontend env before building** — All `VITE_*` variables are baked into the production bundle at build time:
   - `VITE_API_URL` → backend API (e.g. `https://api.example.com/api`)
   - `VITE_SOCKET_URL` → backend Socket.IO (e.g. `https://api.example.com`)
   - `VITE_API_ORIGIN` → backend origin for media URLs (e.g. `https://api.example.com`)

   Set them before running `npm run build`.

3. **JWT_SECRET** — Use a strong, random secret. Generate one with:
   ```bash
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
   ```

4. **Cron/scheduler flags** — All schedulers are disabled by default. Enable only those you need:
   - `ENABLE_BOOKING_REMINDERS`
   - `ENABLE_WAITLIST_EXPIRATION`
   - `ENABLE_SUBSCRIPTION_EXPIRATION_CRON`
   - `ENABLE_CLEANUP_NON_WORKING_DAYS_CRON`
   - `ENABLE_EXPIRE_PENDING_BOOKINGS_CRON`
   - `ENABLE_EVENT_REMINDERS_CRON`

5. **Dev/manual subscription endpoints** — The following endpoints are **disabled in production** and return 403:
   - `POST /api/subscriptions/dev/grant`
   - `POST /api/subscriptions/dev/extend`
   - `POST /api/subscriptions/payment-attempts/:attemptId/dev-confirm`

6. **Payment provider** — A real payment provider is not yet integrated. `PAYMENT_PROVIDER=manual` is the default and does not charge real money. `PAYMENT_PROVIDER=disabled` keeps deposit/subscription payments pending without creating checkout URLs. `mock`/`test` providers are development-only and are rejected in production. Real provider adapters must implement payment intent creation plus webhook signature verification and webhook event parsing before paid state can be trusted.

   Payment attempts support `subscription` and `booking_deposit` purposes. Booking deposits remain `depositStatus=pending` until a verified provider webhook confirms payment. Pending deposits are not counted as paid revenue.

7. **Debug routes** — `/api/debug/*` routes are only available in `NODE_ENV=development`.

### Files & directories that must NOT be committed

- `backend/.env` — contains secrets
- `frontend/.env` — contains environment config
- `backend/node_modules/`, `frontend/node_modules/`
- `frontend/dist/` — build output
- `backend/uploads/` — user-uploaded files

### Serving uploads

The backend serves uploaded files via Express static middleware at `/uploads/*` paths for multiple directories: `avatars`, `certifications`, `events`, `certificate-files`, `portfolio`. Booking reference images under `uploads/booking-references/` are intentionally not public; they are served only through the protected booking image route after booking ownership/manager checks. Configuration uses:
- `dotfiles: "deny"` — prevents serving dotfiles
- `fallthrough: false` — returns 404 instead of falling through
- `index: false` — disables directory listing

### MongoDB

- Provide the connection string via `MONGO_URI` environment variable.
- For MongoDB Atlas, use a `mongodb+srv://` connection string with credentials.
- The server exits immediately if the connection fails.

### SPA routing

The frontend is a single-page application. In production, configure your web server to serve `dist/index.html` for all unmatched routes:

```nginx
location / {
  try_files $uri /index.html;
}
```

### SPA fallback routes

The app uses browser-history routing. Deep-linked routes like:
- `/barbers`, `/barbers/:id/profile`
- `/salons`, `/salons/:salonId/book`
- `/my-bookings`, `/favorites`
- `/admin`, `/admin/salon/dashboard`, `/admin/salon/calendar`
- `/messages`, `/notifications`, `/events`

must all fall back to `index.html` for page reload or direct navigation to work.

### Security notes

- JWT tokens are required for most API routes (except login, register, health, public booking, and public certificate verification).
- Socket.IO connections require a valid JWT token in the handshake auth or Authorization header.
- The `requireBarberSubscription` middleware enforces paid access — unpaid barbers receive `403 SUBSCRIPTION_REQUIRED`.
- Debug routes are only available in development.
- CORS is restricted to `CLIENT_URL` origins in production.
- The backend also disables `X-Powered-By`, sets `nosniff`, frame-deny, referrer, permissions headers on all responses, and emits JSON instead of HTML for unexpected middleware/CORS errors.
- Manual/dev payment confirmation is disabled in production. Production webhook handling rejects manual/disabled fake paid events; only a future provider adapter with verified webhook confirmation should mark payment attempts paid.
- Rate limiting is enabled by default outside `NODE_ENV=test` and returns `{ "message": "Too many requests, please try again later.", "code": "RATE_LIMITED" }` for limited requests. Tune the `RATE_LIMIT_*` values for production traffic patterns.
- `TRUST_PROXY=true` sets Express `trust proxy` to one hop. Enable it only when the app is behind a trusted reverse proxy/load balancer such as nginx, Render, Railway, or a similar platform that controls forwarded IP headers.

### Upload persistence

The backend stores uploaded files on local disk under `backend/uploads/`. This is **not suitable for multi-instance production deployments**. For production:
- Use a shared filesystem (NFS, EFS) mounted at `backend/uploads/`, **or**
- Replace the multer disk storage with cloud object storage (S3, GCS, R2) and update `getMediaUrl()` and the static middleware accordingly.

### Version control notes

- Always commit `package-lock.json` to ensure reproducible installs.
- Never commit `.env` files — they contain secrets.
- `node_modules/`, `dist/`, and `backend/uploads/` are already excluded via `.gitignore`.

---

## Roadmap / Next Possible Work

The following features are planned or possible future enhancements:

- **Real payment provider integration** — The payment attempt lifecycle (`createPaymentIntent` → pending → confirm) is ready but currently uses manual/dev confirmation. Integrate with Stripe, Idram, Telcell, or other providers via the provider factory.
- **Staff / Chair Renter confirmation flow** — Relationship type changes are saved but the full confirmation UX between owner and barber could be enhanced.
- **Mobile app** — Native or React Native mobile client.
- **Advanced marketing / promotions** — Coupon campaigns, referral programs, targeted promotions.
- **Deposits / no-show payments** — Require a deposit at booking time; charge no-show fees.
- **Advanced analytics** — Deeper business intelligence, trends, forecasting.
- **Email notifications** — The email service (`resend` provider) is configured but many notification types still use in-app notifications only.

---

## Deployment

The frontend and backend can be deployed separately. The backend is a Node.js/Express server; the frontend is a static SPA built with Vite.

### Backend deploy

```bash
cd backend
npm ci                 # clean install from lockfile
npm test               # requires local MongoDB
npm start              # starts Node.js server
```

### Frontend deploy

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci                 # clean install from lockfile
npm run build          # produces static output in dist/
```

Then serve `frontend/dist/` with any static file server, ensuring SPA fallback.

### Quick reference: env variables to set before building

| Context | Variable | Example |
